      <article>
        Founded in 1908 by a committee of private citizens with royal patronage in 1908 and became a state institution under King Fuad I in 1925.<br>
        It was renamed a after the 1952 Egyptian Revolution.Its early founding and location made it a model for later universities throughout the Arab world. It was taken over as a state university in 1925 and became Cairo University in 1954.
        Significant contributions were made by Princess Fatma Ismail. In the early 1900s, she donated land to the university as a part of her fundraising campaign for the establishment of Egypt's first formal university
        It is the second oldest institution of higher education in Egypt

              Under the auspices of the university administration and the supervision of the college administration, and in cooperation with the Youth Welfare Department, the college students union organizes the largest iftar for students in the history of the college
      The main courtyard of the college is decorated with a Ramadan lantern designed by the college students through the iftar tables of more than five hundred fasting students.
      With fasting meals, Coptic students participate in the celebrated event in an atmosphere of love and fun. Only in guarded Egypt are the two fasts synchronized and those who fast are united in the love of their college.

              Computer Science is the academic discipline concerned with computing.
                The intellectual processes of the discipline combinetheory,
                abstraction, and design. Problems are solved in a distinctive manner,
                with an overall goal of identifying and applying recurring conceptual
                principles. Although these intellectual processes derive from other
                disciplines, a computer scientist’s perspective offers a unique and
                important voice in a community of learning such as a liberal-arts
                college.
